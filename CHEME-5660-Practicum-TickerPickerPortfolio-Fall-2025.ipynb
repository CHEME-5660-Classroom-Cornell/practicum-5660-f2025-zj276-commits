    "For a concrete implementation that includes ticker-picker preferences, suppose we use the single index model in combination with the ticker-picker data. This gives a feature vector $\\mathbf{x}_{i} = \\left(1,\\mathbb{E}(\\bar{g}_{m}),p_{i}(\\lambda)\\right)$, where $\\mathbb{E}(\\bar{g}_{m})$ is the expected growth rate of the market portfolio and $p_{i}(\\lambda)$ is the ticker-picker preference for asset $i$ given risk aversion parameter $\\lambda$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters $\\theta_{i} = \\left(\\alpha_{i}/\\beta^{\\lambda},\\beta^{1-\\lambda}_{i},\\xi\\right)$ represent the risk-scaled firm-specific growth and relative risk with respect to the market portfolio, and $\\xi$ is the weight of the investor's preference for the asset as given by the ticker-picker model (default weight of $\\xi = 1$). Using the $\\texttt{tanh}$ activation function, the coefficients are modeled as:\n",

However, the $\\texttt{tanh}$ activation function can produce negative values. In our portfolio construction algorithm, we handle this by forcing a minimum share purchase of $\\epsilon$ shares for any asset with $\\gamma_i < 0$.
